# Morphemes and Tokens

## What I want to understand
- Difference between **characters**, **morphemes**, **words**, and **tokens**.
- Why morphemes matter for NLP (e.g., *law* → *lawful*, *care* → *careful*).
- How this connects to tokenization in modern LLMs.

## Notes

- **Morpheme**: smallest meaning-carrying unit (e.g., `law`, `care`, `-ful`).
- Humans naturally decompose words into morphemes; models need this modeled explicitly.
- Classic NLP sometimes uses stemming/lemmatization; modern LLMs use subword tokenization.
