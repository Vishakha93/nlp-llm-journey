# Subword Tokenization

## Goals
- Understand why full word tokenization is problematic (OOV, huge vocab).
- Understand the idea of **subwords** as a middle ground between characters and words.

## Key Ideas
- Subwords help handle:
  - Rare words
  - Misspellings
  - Morphologically rich languages
- Used by: BPE, WordPiece, SentencePiece, etc.
